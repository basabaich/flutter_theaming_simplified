  //creates a "type" of that class & which comes within "<...>" and this
  //"type" holds valuable information of the object of that class.
  //
  //
  //Note as we have defined all the objects in the "expense.dart" file
  //within the class "Expense", so we need to import that file here at the
  //top and then we will call it's "type" with a variable.
  //
  //
  //We also call that "type" which holds object's information of that class
  //with a variable which start with like "_xyzabc". We treat this as a list
  //and so the format as below:-
  //
  final List<Expense> _registeredExpenses = [
    Expense(
      title: 'Flutter course',
      amount: 19.99,
      date: DateTime.now(),

    //
    //
    Expense(
      title: 'Cinema',
      amount: 15.69,
      date: DateTime.now(),
      category: Category.leisure,
    ), //Expense
  ];

  //New method added to control plus button click event at AppBar
  //This function / method when called by clicking the plus sign
  //on the AppBar will open up a "Modal bottom sheet".
  // void _openAddExpenseOverlay() {
  //   showModalBottomSheet(
  //     //#######################################################
  //     isScrollControlled: true, //IF this is set to "true" then the modal bottom
  //     //sheet will be of full screen
  //     //######################################################
  //     context: context,
  //     builder: (ctx) => NewExpense(onAddExpense: _addExpense),
  //     //In the "NewExpense" class the pattern of "Modal Bottom Sheet" is
  //     //designed & we are calling it from here through "NewExpense".
  //   );
  // }

  //
  //
  //Adding a new method called "addExpense". We need to get the value of
  //"expense" of type "Expense". The method "_addExpense" will show an error
  // as it is never executed. Now this method we need to tie up with the
  //submit button code / login inside the class "NewExpense".
  // void _addExpense(Expense expense) {
  //   setState(() {
  //     _registeredExpenses.add(expense);

  //We need to put "_registeredExpenses" inside the "setState()", so
  //that all dynamic changes by the user can be
  // recorded.
  //we include the "add" method here with the "_registeredExpenses" & in
  //the add method we pass on the variable against which we will get the
  //value i.e. "expense".
  //We will update the changed list in the "body" of this class i.e.
  //"Expenses" class, whenever the data is updated by clicking the "Submit"
